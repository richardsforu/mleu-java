	 *  Garbage Collection
	 *  -----------------------
	 *  	-> managing the JVM memory
	 *  	-> know the total size of memory, available size etc
	 *  	-> manage java objects to destroy or deallocate memory to the specified objects
	 *  	-> "Mark and Sweep" is used to manage the un-used java objects
	 *  
	 *    Many ways to clear unused objects
	 *    -----------------------------------
	 *    -> cross clean
	 *    -> horizantal
	 *    -> vertical 
	 *    -> stright
	 *    -> reverse
	 *    
	 *    
	 *    Notes
	 *    -------
	 *    1. finalize methods executed before the object is garbage collected
	 *    2. garbage collection invocation is depending on the availability memory in the heap space
	 *    3. we can invoke this garbage collection by calling System.gc
	 *
