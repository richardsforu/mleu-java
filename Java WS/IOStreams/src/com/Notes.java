	/* 		IO Streams
	 * 	-------------------
	 * 	-> Stream  means flow of characters
	 * 	-> To persist data into the local hard drive or storage
	 * 
	 * 
	 *   Two Types of Streams
	 *   -----------------------
	 *   	1. Byte
	 *   	2. Character Streams
	 *   
	 *   1. Byte Streams
	 *   ------------------
	 *   -> Data store sin the formant of bytes
	 *   
	 *   Top Level abstract classes for the byte streams
	 *   	1. InputStream
	 *   	2. OutputStream
	 *   
	 *   
	 *   2. Character Streams
	 *   ---------------------
	 *   -> data stores in the format of character
	 *   
	 *  Top Level abstract classes for the
	 *  	1. Reader
	 *  	2. Writer
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  
	 *       IO Operations 
	 *       ---------------
	 *       1. File Operations
	 *       2. Devices Management
	 *       3. Objects Operations
	 *       
	 *       
	 *       1. File Operations
	 *       ----------------------
	 *       	1. File Class
	 *       		-> Can be used only to verify file attributes like can read, can write, hidden? etc
	 *       		-> This class can not write or read data into file
	 *       		-> This class can create a blank file, and can create directry and directories
	 *       
	 *       	-> Byte file Operations
	 *       		-> FileInputStream -> for reading from files in the binary format
	 *       		-> FileOutputStream -> for writing the data files in to file in the binary format
	 *       		
	 *       
	 *  		-> Character file Operations
	 *  			-> FileReader  -> for reading data from the files in the character format
	 *  			-> FileWriter  -> for writing the data to the files in the character format.
	 *  
	 *     2. Devices Management
		-------------------------------
				-> InputDevices like Keyboard, Scanner, Web camera etc
				-> OutputDevices like Monitor, Printer etc
				
		
	 *       3. Objects Operations
	 *       -----------------------
	 *       
	 *       	-> Write entire object data to a file
	 *       	-> Read entire object data from the file
	 *       
	 *       
	 *
